Welcome to FTShare Objective C library for iOS development.

Implementation Instructions:

* Import SystemConfiguration, CFNetwork, MobileCoreServices, MEssageUI frameworks to your library
* Create an Instance of FTShare on your Application Delegate
* Overwrite the method application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation: on your Application Delegate
* Use the Application delegate FTShare instance everywhere in your app by:
    - setUp the keys for each share components (use config.h)
    - Implement the delegates
    - use shareViaFacebook/Twitter/Mail with the specific FTShareDataObject or
    - use showActionSheetWithtitle:andOptions: implementing the Facebook/Twitter/MailShareData delegate 
* on the app-info.plist add the "URL types". Forget to do so and your app will not respond effectively after the facebook login has completed
